# Stella's Portfolio Site

This is my personal and 100% original Bootstrap powered portfolio site! I've recently added some JQuery animations to the portfolio page, and my goal is continue updating the site to look sleeker and perform better as I learn more. And of course, I will be continuing to add cooler and cooler projects.

## To Do List

* Recreate the entire portfolio as a single page application (When I learn react)
* Recreate the slide animation on the portfolio page to work in reverse
* Add social media buttons/links to the about me page, possibly using FA
* Even up the description boxes to be flush with the images
